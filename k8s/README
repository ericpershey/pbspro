# There are some timing issues with startup and you may
# need to run run_cluster multiple times to get all the
# pbs services running and added.
#
# To start the cluster run the following:
./build_docker_images.sh
./run_cluster.sh
kubectl exec -it pbspro-server -- /opt/pbs/bin/pbsnodes -a
kubectl exec -it pbspro-server -- /bin/bash
